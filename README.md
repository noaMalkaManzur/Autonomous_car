# RoboWheel - Autonomous Car

RoboWheel is an autonomous vehicle project focused on developing self-driving cars capable of analyzing and navigating through their surroundings without human intervention. 

Using a combination of cutting-edge technologies, including computer vision, machine learning, and IoT devices, this project demonstrates the potential of creating intelligent and self-aware vehicles.

## Overview

Autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving cars, can analyze and navigate through their surroundings without any assistance from humans. Today's self-driving cars use sensors and cameras to gather information about the surroundings and rely on computer vision, machine learning, and other methods to interpret and react to it.

This project involves developing a system that streams video from an ESP32 camera to a PC and uses image processing techniques to determine the speed of the car. The primary goal is to analyze the video stream in real-time and send commands to control the car based on road sign detection.

## Key Features

- Real-time video streaming from ESP32 camera to PC.
- Speed determination through image processing.
- Road sign detection for autonomous navigation.
- Integration of computer vision and IoT technologies.
- Implementation in Python, utilizing Flask for communication, OpenCV for image processing, and PyTorch for machine learning.

## Technologies Used

- ESP32 camera for capturing video feed.
- Python for project implementation.
- Flask for facilitating communication between the camera and PC.
- OpenCV for advanced image processing tasks.
- PyTorch for implementing machine learning algorithms.

## Getting Started

To get started with RoboWheel, follow these steps:

1. Set up the ESP32 camera and ensure it's connected to the PC.
2. Install the required Python.
3. Run the Flask server on the PC to establish communication with the camera.
4. Implement image processing and machine learning algorithms using OpenCV and PyTorch.
5. Analyze the real-time video stream and send commands for autonomous navigation.
